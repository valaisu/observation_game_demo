About the hints:

 - I have provided a set of hints that might help you if you keep starving to death. 
 - Each of the hints provides some knowledge of the world. 
 - The hints a, b are related to one theme, and c-g to another.
 - The number in each hint is based on my estimation on scale from 1-10 of how helpful that hint is.
 - I recommend opening the hints in alphabetical order.
